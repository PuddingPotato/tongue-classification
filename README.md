# Tongue Classification with Convolution Neural Network

This project focuses on classifying tongue health conditions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The characteristics of the tongue are important indicators of oral hygiene and can reflect underlying illnesses. Early identification of abnormal tongue features allows individuals to seek timely medical advice for proper diagnosis.

## üéØ Objective

To develop machine learning models capable of classifying tongue images into different health conditions. The models aim to assist in early detection of potential oral and systemic health issues by analyzing tongue appearances.

## üß† Key Features

- **Two-Stage Classification Models**  
  - **Model 1**: Classifies between **normal** and **abnormal** tongue conditions  
    - Dataset split: 57% training, 18% validation, 25% testing  
    - Achieved **96.49% accuracy**
  - **Model 2**: Classifies among **black hairy tongue**, **cancer-risk tongue**, and **diabetes-risk tongue**  
    - Dataset split: 54% training, 18% validation, 28% testing  
    - Achieved **86.17% accuracy**

- **Data Augmentation**  
  - Performed to improve model robustness and handle limited data availability.

- **Evaluation Results**  
  - Graphs showing training and testing performance (accuracy and loss curves) are available in the `evaluations` folder within each model directory (`model 1`, `model 2`).
